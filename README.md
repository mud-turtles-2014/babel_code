Babel Code
==========

A great new web app built on Rails that lets you post code snippets and have others translate them into different programming languages.

##The Problem
Our goal in creating this app was to increase interest in a variety of programming languages.  It is particularly true of object-oriented languages, but most languages are based in similar logic when it comes to things like iteration and collections, differing more in syntax.  You might know how to iterate over an array and print things out in Ruby, for example, but might be curious as to how you do the same in Python.  Having other users share their understanding of how similar ideas work in different languages increases any one user's understanding of a language that may not be their strength.  Hopefully this understanding will lead to learning more programming languages in the future.
